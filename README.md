# NativeJS bangkok-express restourant order page

### Demo (**https://erastian.github.io/vanillaJS_bangkok-express/**)

The application is written in pure Javascript. 
This is an example of the order page of a small 
Asian restaurant. An example of how the filter 
works for spiciness, the presence of nuts and the 
use of meat. The dishes are divided into categories 
for easy selection.

No remote server was used for storage. 
All data about the dishes are contained 
in the `products.json` file. Slider data is 
contained in the file `/js/modules/slides.js`


### For installation use command
```sh
$ npm i
```


### For run project
```sh
$ npm run dev
```


#### Thank you for your patience )))
